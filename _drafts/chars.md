They are certainly the most recognizable feature of the Chinese language: its characters. Chances are the writing system is what drew you to this language in the first place. They are fascinating and unique but also daunting and foreign. Since there are many misconceptions in popular culture of how Characters work, I thought the best way to start this chapter is by answering a few common questions.

### Are characters pictures? How can you represent abstract concepts like "love" using Chinese characters?

This is probably the most widespread misconception people have about Chinese characters. Like all writing systems, Chinese characters initially developed out of drawings and pictographic representation of information. While it's true that these pictographic roots are still more visible in today's characters than in many other writing systems, only a small number of characters today are pictographs of the thing they stand for.

In reality, Chinese characters are combinations of phonetic and semantic information. Since they were formed organically as the language developed, they are full of irregularities and corruptions. We will go over the system underlying the characters later in this chapter. 

### Are Chinese characters the equivalent of English words?

No, Chinese characters don't have a direct equivalent in European languages. While almost all characters have a meaning attached to them (unlike letters in English), many Chinese words are combinations of multiple characters.

### How many characters do I need to know?

This question is hard to answer definitively. However, as a consequence of the answer to the previous question, it's probably less than you think. According to the internet, a native speaker knows around 20,000 to 35,000 words, so if every word in Chinese was written down with a unique character, there would have to be as many characters in common use. Since that's not the case, the actual number of Chinese characters you will need to learn is much smaller. Once you hit the 3,000 character mark, you'll rarely encounter characters you don't know in everyday life.

### Are there still new characters being formed?

The answer to this question is pretty much "no". Even though [new characters do sometimes pop up](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=17913), they are mostly a novelty and disappear as quickly as they go viral. Since newly created characters can not be displayed on computers, people resort to posting images of these characters or describing the way they look using their constituent components. This is very unwieldy and puts a big barrier on the invention of new characters.

Rather than create new characters, people combine several existing ones to form new words. One of countless examples of this is the Chinese word for "computer" (電腦), a combination of the characters for "electronic" and "brain".

## Basics

If every character was a completely unique combination of strokes, even memorizing 3,000 characters would probably be an unsurmountable challenge. Luckily, Chinese characters are composed of a limited set of basic components. This means rather than having to remember the individual strokes for each character, the way you eventually memorize them is by the components they comprise.

### Some Examples

Let's see how this works in practice. The first character we'll look at is 心. This character, meaning "heart", is made up of four strokes and can't be broken down into any further components. It does, however, appear as a component in more complex characters such as 想 meaning "to think". 想 is made up of two components: 相 at the top and 心 at the bottom. Since the entire character has to fit into a square, the 心 gets squeezed a little.

Let's look at a more complex example: the character 照. This character means "to illuminate" and is made up of two parts: 昭 at the top and 灬 at the bottom. 昭 can further be decomposed into 日 and 召. Finally, 召 is made up of 刀 and 口. These decompositions form a tree with the character at the root and basic components that can't be further broken down at the leaves.

### Meanings & Pronunciations

Generally, every Chinese characters has three properties: its shape, i.e. the way it's written, its pronunciation and its meaning. With almost no exceptions, every character is exactly one syllable long.

As the rules of how syllables can be formed are quite restrictive, Mandarin Chinese is a language full of homonyms, meaning characters that have the same pronunciation. Typing one of the common syllables like "shi" or "yi" into a pinyin input method will reveal dozens of characters with that pronunciation. This is the reason that China didn't switch to a phonetic writing system like Vietnam and Korea, countries where Chinese characters were used in the past.

Just as there are cases of multiple characters sharing the same pronunciation, there are also characters that have more than one pronunciation. These characters are called 多音字 in Chinese and heteronyms in English. They are far less common in Chinese than in Japanese where nearly all characters have this property but they can catch you by surprise. When a character has multiple pronunciations, these pronunciations usually each has a different meaning associated with them. An example for this is the character 行, which means "to walk" when it's pronounced xing2, but "profession" when pronounced "hang2".

### More about Components

You've already encountered a few components, let's talk some more about them since they are so important.

Some of the basic components used to produce characters are also characters by themselves, like 人. Others can not stand by themselves, such as 宀. Some more complex characters are made up of components that are themselves characters made up of sub-components, like you saw earlier with 照.

One noteworthy detail about components is how they change shape when appearing in composite characters. Some of this is due to the fact that all Chinese characters are squeezed and stretched to fit into a square when written. Some characters, however, have two or more forms, depending on whether they appear as stand-alone characters or as components in other characters. While this sounds confusing, they are limited in number and usually very common. Still, this is something you should pay attention too in the beginning, since drawing the connection between the full form and the component form will help you make sense of the component's purpose. If you keep seeing a component appear in new characters you learn, look it up, it might just be the component form of a character you already know!

You already saw how 心 got squeezed when it formed the bottom half of 想. This leaves the component still quite recognizable. When 心 appears at the left, rather than at the bottom, of a character, it has a different form: 忄 like in the character 忆. Another component you saw as part of the character 照 is 灬. This is the component form of the character 火, meaning "fire".

There aren't too many of these alternate forms so make sure you learn them early on. Being able to draw the right connections is very valuable in interpreting a character's components. It also happens to be something that gets glossed over or not talked about at all at many schools.

### Components, Sound & Meaning

All this talk of components and how they are used to form characters gives rise to an obvious question: why are some components used to write a particular characters and not others? While this question is easy to ask, it doesn't always have a simple answer. Very often, though, the components of a character are in some way connected to the other two properties of the character besides its shape: its meaning and its pronunciation.

Let's take the character 請 as an example: it's made up of 言 on its left and 青 on its right, means "to invite" and is pronounced qing3. 言 is a component meaning "speech" or "communication" and suggests the meaning "to invite". 青 is pronounced qing1 and forms the sound component of 請.

To see how useful this can be, let's look at a few more characters that contain the "speech/language" component 言:

- 說 to say
- 話 speech
- 評 to criticize
- 語 language
- 講 to speak
- 詠 to chant
- 詩 poetry
- 詛 to curse
- 詢 to inquire
- 讀 to read

If we look at the other component in the character 請, its sound component 青 qing1, we again find a large number of characters that contain this component:

- 蜻 qing1
- 清 qing1
- 情 qing2
- 精 jing1
- 靜 jing4
- 靖 jing4
- 倩 qian1
- 猜 cai1

These characters are ordered by how closely their pronunciation matches the sound component 青. Since the sounds of ancient and modern Chinese have shifted and changed over the centuries since these characters came about, the degree of accuracy with which sound components predict a character's pronunciation varies widely.

Even still, knowing this stuff is tremendously useful and will help you save a lot of work. As a final example, let's look at two components that are often confused by beginners since they look so much alike: 艮 (gen4) and 良 (liang2). These two characters only differ in one stroke (the dot at the top) and appear commonly as components in other characters such as 浪 (wave), 狼 (wolf), 狠 (fierce), 酿 (to ferment), 娘 (mother), 很 (very), 銀 (silver), 眼 (eye), 養 (to itch) and 跟 (to follow). Remembering where to add the dot is an exercise in rote memorization until you look at each character's pronunciation:

#### Sound component 良 liang2 (with dot)
- 浪 lang4
- 狼 lang2
- 酿 niang4
- 娘 niang2
- 養 yang3

#### Sound component 艮 gen4 (without dot)
- 狠 hen3
- 很 hen3
- 銀 yin2
- 眼 yan3
- 跟 gen1

Most composite characters are sound-meaning compounds like 請 (qing3, to invite). There are other types of component combinations include characters with two meaning compounds, like the character 好 meaning "good" that's made up of a woman 女, with her child 子, that you will learn. There are also many characters, however, with more more arbitrary and irregular origins. Additionally, there is a lot of incorrect explanations and folk-etymology inside China and out.

My advice would be to extract as much information that actually helps you in your studies from each new character as possible and then get on with it. Treating every character as a meaning-meaning compound, one of the hallmarks of bad character explanations, ignores sound components that can help you remember a character's pronunciation. On the other hand, drilling into the etymology for every character always reminds me of people in high school who spent years learning Latin because "it will help with learning French". This stuff is fascinating later on but for some characters, knowing its origin just overloads you with information that doesn't help you remember it.

One thing I should mention is that many components have a tendency as to which role they appear in, sound or meaning. Components such as 言 (speech), 氵 (water) and 扌 (hand) usually have to do with a character's meaning. Others, like 青 (qing1), 交 (jiao1) and 艮 (gen3) are mostly used to give pronunciations. This is not an ironclad rule and how much it holds true differs between components. It's something you'll probably pick up as you go.

### Stroke Order

When you write a Chinese character by hand, there is a standardized order in which to write it, its stroke order. While correct stroke order isn't too important in my opinion (especially for foreigners like us who, let's face it, will almost never hand write anything once we leave school), it's based on a small set of rules that are easy to pick up so you might as well learn it. These rules go as follows:

1. Top left to bottom right. Components are generally, though not always, written one after the other, which is why in 漢, you write 氵 first whereas in 字, 宀 comes first. 
2. Outside to inside, closing frames last. The stroke order of the character 國 goes 冂, then the 或 inside, then you close the frame with the bottom stroke. For 區, you first write the 一 at the top, then the 品 inside and finally close the left and bottom sides of the frame with one L-shaped stroke.
3. Horizontal before intersecting vertical strokes. 十 is written 一, then 丨.
4. Center before symmetrical sides. The stroke order for the character 小 begins with the long vertical stroke in the middle, followed by the smaller ones on the left and the right.

Additionally, you always move your pen to the right or the bottom as you write a stroke, never to the left or to the top. 

### Radicals

If you've done some reading on Chinese characters, online or in books, you'll likely have seen radicals mentioned somewhere. Usually, they are described as the building blocks of characters which we have been calling components in this guide.

"Radical" is a somewhat strange translation of the Chinese 部首 meaning "section head". This refers to the original purpose of radicals that prompted their invention: categorizing characters into sections in dictionaries and making it easier to look them up. As you can probably imagine, looking up a character in a dictionary that contains thousands of them is no easy task.

The way that dictionary authors tried to solve this problem was to assign each character to one of its components. All the components that had at least one character assigned to them were used as the index. If you wanted to look up a character, you'd first determine its radical (which can be hard on its own) and then go to the appropriate section in the dictionary, substantially reducing the number of pages you'd have to scour.

This means that radicals are not a very good fit for the purpose of learning characters. Many common components are not radicals, since all the characters that contain them were categorized under a different component. Conversely, there are some radicals that are very rare and aren't worth spending time on in the beginning.

## Simplified & Traditional

Since things aren't complex enough already, Chinese characters come in two versions: simplified and traditional. Simplified characters are the result of a simplification process that happened in China during the 50s and 60s. To facilitate literacy, the government reduced the number of strokes in many characters. This was done in ways such as replacing complex components with simpler ones, merging strokes according to the rules of cursive handwriting or calligraphy, combining several characters into one and others.

Since this was only done to a limited number of characters, focussing on the more frequently occurring ones, there is still a large overlap of characters that are used the same in both. Of the characters that were simplified, many simplifications are the result of simplifying a small number of components and as such are easy to map.

Simplified characters are used in Mainland China and in Singapore. Taiwan and Hong Kong still use traditional characters. In the Chinese diaspora abroad, you'll find a mix of both. Which one you learn is probably determined by the school you go to or the country you're in.

Character simplification can be a sensitive topic and many a flame war has been fought online over which of the two character sets is superior. My personal opinion is that the difference is mostly exaggerated and that it doesn't really matter which one you learn. If you stick with the language, you'll probably learn the other eventually anyway. Once you know one set of characters, the other isn't very hard to pick up.

## Frequency & Complexity

One curious feature of Chinese characters is that the correlation between how common a character is and how complex it is to write is quite weak. Some very common characters, such as 
題 or 數, have a fairly high number of strokes, yet other, simpler ones like 乞 or 巾 appear much less often. This poses somewhat of a problem for learners of the language since you have to choose between learning useful characters first and learning the components before learning a character. Almost all text books and schools go with the first approach. The first lesson of my text book when I started learning Chinese in Taiwan contained the characters 臺 (tai2) and 灣 (wan1).

After I dropped out of that language school to study using methods I'd read about online I went back and used a different book that takes the second approach. One of the characters that book included in one of its first lesson is 旭, a rare character meaning "the rising sun" that is formed from two very simple components: 九 (nine) and 日 (sun).

Which approach you favor is probably determined by whether you are looking for applicable knowledge that you can use in the outside world or whether you are more fascinated by a principles based approach to the language.
