# About Me

I'm Jan Söndermann. I lived in Taipei in 2010 and 2011 and in Beijing from 2015 to 2017. In between, I studied computer science in the UK. I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to best learn Mandarin, the main outcome of which is [Primlo](https://www.primlo.com), a Chinese language learning app. These days, I'm back in London working in tech.

This blog is made with jekyll and a handcrafted theme. It's hosted on github pages. I hope to eventually find the time to write my own blogging software with support for comments and an email list.

You can contact me at <a href="mailto:jan.soendermann+blog@gmail.com">jan.soendermann+blog@gmail.com</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/jsoendermann">Twitter</a>. I'm not very active on social media except for <a href="https://github.com/jsoendermann">GitHub</a>, if that counts as social.
