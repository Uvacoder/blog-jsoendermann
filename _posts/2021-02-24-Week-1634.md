- The weather is getting nice in London! Lockdown is easing soon and vaccination numbers are rising.
- I've been using my Kindle more and more recently. I got one of the old Kindles (paperwhite? Maybe even one before the paperwhite) years ago and never really used it that much. Last year I bought a Kindle Oasis and felt slightly guilty afterwards for splurging on something I wasn't sure I would end up using. However, the way it can be held comfortably in one hand and how much more responsive than my old one is have made using it an enjoyable experience. Of course, it has [brought with it new problems](/Retaining-What-I-Read/) or rather uncovered possibilities. I have an update on the retaining problem in the pipeline, expect that to be published in the coming days.
- I'm bored of my current blog design and I've always wanted to make something using a <span style="font-family: monospace;">monospaced</span> font and <span style="color: fuchsia">fuchsia</span> for accents.
- I recently started finally reading [*The Four Steps To The Epiphany*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/0989200507) after having read some other books on customer development and lean methodologies. It's... dense. No wonder other people had to pre-digest and repackage his ideas before they became popular.
- Cancer sucks!
