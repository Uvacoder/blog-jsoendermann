title: Retaining What I Read

I've been reading mostly non-fiction lately and I find myself wanting to remember more of what I read. I highlight things as I read, both in physial books and on my Kindle but never really do anything with those highlights. Thinking about this problem today, I remembered the [incremental reading technique](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/help/read) invented by the supermemo guy. He wrote a long article on his website about it but essentially it's the idea of creating flashcards while reading. People nerd out hard when it comes to spaced repetition and it's easy to mindlessly optimise but perhaps a combination of Kindle highlights and SRS is something that's worth experimenting with. I'll write a follow up post if I decide to try anything like that.
