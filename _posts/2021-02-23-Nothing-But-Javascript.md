All I ever write these days is Javascript! At home, at work, whenever I try to use something new, I end up coming back to the language I know best and the language that can do it all: web with React, backend with node, mobile with react native (although RN seems to have lost much of its steam, I wonder how much longer it has to live). I remember a few years ago, people were complaining of Javascript fatigue: feeling exhausted at having to keep up with the most dynamic ecosystem of all the languages out there. My problem is that that dynamism makes it hard to pick anything else because solving the problems I'm faced with become harder if I try to solve them in another language.
