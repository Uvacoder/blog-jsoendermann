The fun is over! I made it.

After the halfway point, I noticed that indulgent fun like video games became much less appealing. In fact, 30 days was probably too long for this experiment and two weeks would've been a better time interval. Still, I'm glad I did it. It was the first real world test for my [daily countdown](/Count-Down-The-Days/) which did its job very well.

I've started another experiment involving art and painting that I might blog about here at a later point and a productivity thing that needs some more experimentation as well before it's ready to be shared. I'm planning to blog more again in the coming weeks to exercise that writing muscle.

I also just spent five minutes adding a "Greatest Hits" section to the homepage of this blog with the posts I'm most proud of.
