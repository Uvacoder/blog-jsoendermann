Monospaced again (the one before the last one was too). I think it looks nice and clean. Maybe the list of posts all in fuchsia on the homepage is a little too bright.

Sometimes I play with the idea of extending this website to more than just a list of posts, maybe a "stuff I've done" section would be cool. I'm still not sure if soender.blog was a good choice for a domain or not. My given names and my last names are all impossible to spell, pronounce and remember for native English speakers. I got the idea for "SÃ¶nderblog" from [Erik Spikermann's blog](https://spiekermann.com/) and at the time I wanted to try one of the new tlds.
