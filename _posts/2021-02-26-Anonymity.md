I'm one week into my month of blogging and it's been hard finding things I'm excited to write about. Maybe it's because the things that occupy my mind at the moment don't lend themselves to being written about. One thing I'm interested to try is to find out what it would feel like to blog anonymously. I'm a fairly private person on the internet and there are some things I don't feel comfortable publishing under my real name. I have a project in mind already and might just try writing a few posts without publishing them right away to see how it goes.
