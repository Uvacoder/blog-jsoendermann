title: "30 Days of... Fun!"
---
Something I often struggle with is getting started on activities I know will be fun once I'm doing them. Instead, I keep doomscrolling, mindlessly browsing the internet or I stay in bed when the day is calling. On top of that, when I do find something that's fun but unproductive, I end up feeling guilty for not doing something more productive with my time.

That's why today, I'm embarking on a 30 day journey of fun. For the next 30 days, all non-essential responsibilities are put on hold and my goal is to have as much fun as possible. The only rule is that whenever I think of something more fun to do with my time, I change what I'm doing.
