I recently started playing chess again after about 15 years of not playing more than 5 matches in total. Even in high school, I was never any good at it but I used to play with my dad and some of my class mates. I'm somewhat motivated to improve my skill, even though right now I mostly play strangers on the internet. So far, the thing I enjoy the most are chess puzzles either from lichess or [The Ultimate Chess Puzzle Book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007M2GHL0/). Depending on how my interest develops, I might blog about this again this month and maybe make a plan for how I can improve my elo.
