I interned at [Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk/) last summer which was a great experience. As part of my internship, I did some data scraping work that was used [in a report that was just published](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/found-in-translation-how-social-media-platforms-can-help-uk-publishers-understand-their-market-in-china/). It examines Chinese media consumption of British cultural exports and how British artists could use social media platform to reach new audiences in China.

*Note (27 Feb 2021): I wrote this post back in 2015 but for some reason it never got published.*
