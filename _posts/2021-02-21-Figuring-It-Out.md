> The hard part about figuring out what customers want is figuring out that you need to figure it out.

*-- [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html)*

I found this quote in *[Lean Customer Development](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Customer-Development-Building-Customers/dp/1449356354)* by Cindy Alvarez which I'm planning to write a review on soon. The linked article has another quote in the footnotes that I quite like:

> Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup: "Watch people who have money to spend, see what they're wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. It's surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution."
