![countdown]({{ '/images/countdown.jpeg' | relative_url}})

A fresh batch of pi zeroes arrived yesterday and I finally got around to building something I've wanted for a while. It's a countdown that counts down the days until a date I choose made with [the pimoroni four letter phat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/four-letter-phat). The code for it is [on Github](https://github.com/jsoendermann/count-down-the-days) but it's not much more than two endpoints one to get and one to set and a script that runs on the pi, polls the date and sets the display.

I strapped the pi to the transformer of one of my monitors so it's always in view. I'm planning to use it to track some of my 90-day goals this year. Speaking of goals, today is also the start of a 30-day blogging marathon so expect some more activity on this site than usual.
