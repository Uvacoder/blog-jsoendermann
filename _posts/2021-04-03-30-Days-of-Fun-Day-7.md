Things are going pretty well. I have been doing a mix of productive and less productive fun activities: lots of reading, a little bit of coding, playing some video games, journaling, strolling around the neighbourhood, baking a cake for Emma's birthday and some other stuff.

I'm surprised at how the question of what to do next doesn't really pose itself to me as often as I thought it would. Instead, my focus is much more about taking actions when I get that feeling of "I know what would be fun right now but I'm still stuck in some other activity".
