[My recent post about Javascript](/Nothing-But-Javascript/) got me thinking about what cool tech is out there that I would like to learn at some point. Here's the current list:

- *Rust*: I've been wanting to learn Rust for a while, even got started on [a little program that I use in production](https://github.com/jsoendermann/guan). I don't think I'll get back to it before [the second edition of Programming Rust](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1492052590/) is published.
- *Elixir*: Another language I've been eying for a while (I still have an old Erlang book from 10 years ago).
- *Kafka*: I have a project in mind for this: a website that people upload a [.pgn file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) together with their email address to with a pi running stockfish that sends some kind of game analysis to people's inboxes.
- *Advanced SQL*: Since I used Mongo for my personal projects in the past, my SQL knowledge isn't as strong as I would like.
- *Kotlin/Spring*: Maybe this could replace TypeScript/Koa as my default service framework.
- *Clojure*: I've wanted to learn LISP properly since reading SICP in my uni years.
- *AWS*: I might get a chance to use AWS at work soon.
- *SwiftUI*: Maybe. I've always enjoyed mobile programming and SwiftUI looks pretty similar to React in many ways. This one will depend on how much longer React Native will stay usable.
