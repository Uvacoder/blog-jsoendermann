I saw this sign at Yangmingshan the other day:

![sign]({{ '/images/fahuan/IMG_4353.jpg' | relative_url}})

<!--break-->

The interesting bit is the last character.

![sign-gross]({{ '/images/fahuan/IMG_4354.jpg' | relative_url}})

I didn't know the last word and apparently, neither did the person who made this sign. It's 罚锾 (fa2huan2) and means "fine". I wonder if this is the work of a Chinese major visiting the park or if the correction was made before the sign was put up.
